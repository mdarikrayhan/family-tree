# üå≥ Family Tree Builder

A modern, interactive family tree builder built with React, TypeScript, and React Flow. Create, visualize, and manage your family relationships with an intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîó Smart Relationship Visualization
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Family members are automatically arranged by generation (grandparents ‚Üí parents ‚Üí children)
- **Visual Connections**: Different edge types for different relationships:
  - **Blue solid lines**: Parent-child relationships
  - **Pink dashed lines**: Marriage/spouse relationships (animated)
- **Intelligent Positioning**: Spouses are positioned close together, and families are grouped logically

### üë• Comprehensive Member Management
- Add family members with detailed information (name, gender, birth/death dates)
- Establish relationships: parents, children, spouses
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: When you set someone as a spouse, the relationship is automatically reciprocated
- **Smart Parent-Child Linking**: Adding a parent automatically adds the child to their children list

### üíæ Data Persistence
- **Local Storage**: All data is saved locally in your browser
- **Export/Import**: Backup your family tree as JSON files
- **No Backend Required**: Works entirely offline

### üé® Modern UI
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Gender-coded Colors**: Visual distinction between male (blue), female (pink), and other (gray)
- **Interactive Tree**: Zoom, pan, and explore your family tree
- **Spouse Indicators**: See marriage connections directly on member cards

- Zoom in/out with mouse wheel or controls
- Different line types show different relationship types

### Data Management
- **Export**: Click "Export Tree" to download your family data as JSON
- **Import**: Click "Import Tree" to load previously exported data
- **Local Persistence**: Data is automatically saved in your browser

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **React Flow** for interactive tree visualization
- **Zustand** for lightweight state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Key Components
- \`TreeView\`: Interactive family tree visualization
- \`MemberForm\`: Add/edit family member details
- \`MemberNode\`: Individual family member display
- \`MemberCard\`: Member information cards
- \`Toolbar\`: Import/export and tree management

### Data Structure
\`\`\`typescript
interface FamilyMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'other';
  birthDate?: string;
  deathDate?: string;
  relations: {
    fatherId?: string;
    motherId?: string;
    spouseId?: string;
    childrenIds: string[];
  };
